BUILDING:
- generate data using 'make output' from /server
- auto push to git to trigger a new deployment each day
  - possible edge cases?

HEATMAP:
- determine class based on # of cases
- v-bind class to state
- set css for each class to form heatmap

- make a json object including all states for all dates, and list their confirmed, deaths, and recovered
  - e.g.

  'confirmed.json':
  [
    "3/19/20": {
      "Washington": 50,
      "New York": 90
    },
    "3/20/20": {...}
  ]

- how to deal with asynchronous server response while states change color on load?

** note that repo originally began recording individual US cities other than Washington, and state data did not fully appear until 03-10-2020 **

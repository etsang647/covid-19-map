BUILDING:
- generate data using 'make output' from /server
- auto push to git to trigger a new deployment each day
  - possible edge cases?

HEATMAP:
- determine class based on # of cases
- v-bind class to state
- set css for each class to form heatmap

- make a json object including all states for all dates, and list their confirmed, deaths, and recovered
  - e.g.

  [
    "3/19/20": {
      "Washington": {
        "Confirmed": 20,
        "Deaths": 10,
        "Recovered": 2
      }
      "New York": {
        "Confirmed: 90,
        "Deaths": 30,
        "Recovered": 5
      }
    },
    "3/20/20": {...}
  ]
